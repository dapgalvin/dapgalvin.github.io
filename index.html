	<h3> About me</h3>
	<p>
	I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn.  I completed my PhD at the University of Glasgow, where my supervisor was <a href="https://www.maths.gla.ac.uk/~mpowell/">Dr. Mark Powell</a>. For the first two years of my PhD I was at Durham University.  My interests are in topology, specifically in knot theory and manifolds, most often in dimensions 3 and 4.  Currently, I am particularly interested in diffeomorphisms and homeomorphisms of 4-manifolds.  I co-organise the <a href="https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/node/12018">MPIM low-dimensional topology seminar</a>.
