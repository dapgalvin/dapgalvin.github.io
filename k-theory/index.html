	<h2> K-theory and applications</h2>
	<h4> Glasgow topology learning seminar</h4>
	<p>
	This is the homepage for the topology learning seminar running in Semester 2 of 2023.
	The aim is to learn about algebraic K-theory and its applications to topology, including controlled K-theory.  To begin with, we will work through Milnor's book and take detours if necessary.
	</p>
	<p>
	The course is aimed at graduate students and postdocs, although anyone is welcome.
	</p>
	<p>
	The organisers for this seminar are Daniel Galvin and Mark Powell.  The talks will be given by
	the participants.
	</p>
	<h3>Schedule</h3>
	<p>
	The talks will be held on Thursday from 1300-1400 in 311B.
	<ul>
	<li> 1. February 16th - Introduction and motivation / Projective modules and K_0 (Csaba Nagy)
	<li> 2. February 23rd - Dedekind domains (Csaba Nagy)
	<li> 3. March 2nd - Constructing projective modules (Mark Powell)
	<li> 4. March 9th - K_1 and the Whitehead group (Daniel Galvin)
	<li> 5. March 16th - Whitehead torsion (Daniel Galvin)
	<li> 6. March 23rd - The exact sequence associated with an ideal (Michelle Daher)
	</ul>
